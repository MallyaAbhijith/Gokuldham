ASUS ROG STRIX --> origin --> MallyaAbhijith/Gokuldham.git
PREMIO V3 --> origin_copy -->AbhijithMallya/Gokuldham.git

**IMP**Always pull first so that you getto know the changes which are made in the central repo.
	Else when we push doesnt work smoothly.
	Also after pulling u need to commit.

	Pull --> commit --> do the work/changes -> Push
**IMP** (Above mentioned is only for collaborators)

git merge <branch name>
git branch -d <branch to deleted>
git branch --> List all branch
git branch <name of new branch>
git checkout <branch to switch>

If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:

    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> master


Note :: It is not possible to push directly from non host machines (ASUS)
	to the main repo (PREMIO)

To update the local repo with the original repo
::> git pull <remote> <branch>
Note :: remote can be of orignal repo even in non host machine
	Also branch should be main not master
	In local we use master...in github its main

PULL REQUEST should be made from non host machines (or those who can push directly)
