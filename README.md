2.Branching nd Merging --> https://www.varonis.com/blog/git-branching#:~:text=To%20merge%20branches%20locally%2C%20use,to%20bring%20into%20this%20branch. 

Basically we aim at making a repo so that all of our machines have same repo cloned.
Like if gaurav adds a programs etc...even we should be able to contribute to it.
